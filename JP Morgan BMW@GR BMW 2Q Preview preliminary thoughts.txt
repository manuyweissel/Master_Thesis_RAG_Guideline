Price Performance Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Investment Thesis
BMW continues to deliver  a solid roll-out of EVs without 
software issues and  on strong battery performance,  which fuels 
our view that the firm is on its way to deliver an organised 
transition into electrification. We think the company continues 
to be a relative “safe” haven  for investors looking for solid 
execution, a strong balance sheet and a gradual transition into 
electrification.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
BMW (Neutral; Price Target: €105.00)
Investment Thesis
BMW continues to deliver  a solid roll-out of EVs without software issues and on strong 
battery performance,  which  fuels our view that the firm is on its way to deliver an organised 
transition into electrification. We think the company continues to be a relative “safe” haven 
for investors looking for solid execution, a strong balance sheet and a gradual transition into 
electrification.
Valuation
We value BMW on a P/E multiple correlated to its forward-looking Group EBIT margin and 
any stakes in entities at market value or book value. 
Risks to Rating and Price Target
Downside risks derived from higher pricing pressure, as well as limited pricing power to 
pass on incremental costs of EVs. 

Upside risks include: 1) acceleration in demand in key end-markets, 2) strong execution of 
indirect purchasing costs, and 3) lower pricing pressure on EV volumes, allowing BMW to 
pass on incremental costs on EVs.

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: 
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the average 
total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this 
stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Underweight 
[Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the 
analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock 
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the 
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) 
and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock’s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country 
market index, not to those analysts’ coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying 
analyst’s coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan’s research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
