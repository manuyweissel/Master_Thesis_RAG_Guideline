    "## Overview\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a groundbreaking technique in the field of natural language processing (NLP) that merges the extensive knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs) with the specificity and relevance of information retrieval systems. By uploading relevant documents, RAG models can generate responses that are not only contextually accurate but also deeply informed by relevant external data sources. \n",
    "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has become a popular paradigm for enabling LLMs to access external data and also as a mechanism for grounding to mitigate against hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG approach involves two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval of Information:** The model searches a large dataset or corpus to find pieces of information that are relevant to the input query. This dataset can be anything from the entirety of Wikipedia to a specialized database tailored to a specific domain.\n",
    "2. **Generation of Responses:** The model then combines this retrieved information with the original query to generate a response. This process leverages the power of generative models, like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), BERT (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) or Gemini, which are trained to produce coherent and contextually relevant text based on the inputs they receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gemini\n",
    "Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for multimodal use cases. The Gemini API gives you access to the Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision and Gemini 1.0 Pro models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing text-based and multimodal RAG\n",
    "Multimodal RAG offers several advantages over text-based RAG:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhanced knowledge access:** Multimodal RAG can access and process both textual and visual information, providing a richer and more comprehensive knowledge base for the LLM.\n",
    "2. **Improved reasoning capabilities:** By incorporating visual cues, multimodal RAG can make better informed inferences across different types of data modalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to use RAG with Vertex AI Gemini API, [text embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/text-embeddings), and [multimodal embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/multimodal-embeddings), to build a document search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through hands-on examples, you will discover how to construct a multimedia-rich metadata repository of your document sources, enabling search, comparison, and reasoning across diverse information streams. Summarised you will learn how to perform multimodal RAG where you can perform Q&A over a financial document filled with both text and images."
